              At <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">Blissful</span>, beauty is more than skin deep — it's about self-care, confidence, and the little rituals that make us feel good every day.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our journey began with a simple passion: sharing the secrets of Korean skincare with everyone who dreams of healthy, radiant, and glowing skin. After discovering how effective, gentle, and innovative K-beauty products are, we wanted to bring that same experience to you — carefully selected, authentic, and always with love.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We believe skincare should never feel complicated. That's why we choose products that combine natural ingredients, advanced formulas, and a touch of Korean innovation to make your daily routine simple, enjoyable, and effective.

              <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">Blissful</span> is more than a shop — it's a space where beauty meets care, and where every product has been handpicked to help you feel confident in your own skin.
